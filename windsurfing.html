I started windsurfing when I was 12 when my parents suggested I take a beginners lesson. That one lesson launched a lifetime passion for sailing and being in the water. One of the best summers of my life was spent sharing this passion with others as a windsurfing instructor at the local shop.

<p>Windsurfing also sparked my passion for traveling. In 2002 I traveled to Venezuela on a windsurfing vacation. Between the time my Dad and I had booked the trip, and when we got there, the country experienced a socialist nationalization of their vast oil reserves. Although a lot of people were skeptical about being in the country at such a volatile time, my Dad and I loved it and returned again 5 more times over the next ten years.

<p><a href="http://www.continentseven.com">Continent Seven</a> has been one of my favorite sports and travel and blogs to read for the last few years. It features the latest windsurfing related media and travel stories from seasoned professionals to weekend warriors like me.
