<h2> Why I would be a good candidate for Launch Academy </h2>

<div> 
<p>I decided to apply to Launch Academy after I finished a beginner online course in JavaScript from the <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com">Oreilly School of Technology</a>. Towards the end of that course I had hit a wall where it felt like I had read through a lesson one hundred times and still could not figure out the solution. It took me hours commenting out code, debugging, and reading forums on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">stack overflow</a> to finally break through, and get the application to work the correct way.
</p>

<p>It was when I felt the elation of breaking through that wall that I started to think that this could be for me. Then the next chapter came, and it was even harder, and I hit even bigger walls, but I was starting to become comfortable with the process. By the time the final chapter came around, I was really beginning to relish breaking through these walls, and enjoy the process of being able to figure out these problems.
</p>

<p>What got me interested in coding and programs like Launch Academy in the first place were people like Kirk Sorensen, from the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9M__yYbsZ4">Thorium Remix 2011.</a> Kirk is a former aerospace engineer who spent 10 years at NASA, and through researching producing energy for a self-sustaining colony on the moon, found his passion for making Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors a reality as a reliable and sustainable energy source on Earth (although you probably dont have the time I highly recommend at least the first 5 minutes and then skipping to about the 1:40 mark).

 Although the documentary is filled with lots of juicy and exciting tech details that certainly reshaped how I look at the energy debate, what I found particularly inspiring was the way this man talks about it. You can see the emotion that is bubbling right underneath the surface in his eyes, and it makes you really feel his conviction for these ideas.  It really reaches a fever pitch at the 4:40 mark when he is describing the far-reaching implications this technology could have for all of mankind. It raises the hair on your neck and is so captivating and intense that it makes this aerospace and nuclear engineer downright sexy. 

<p> I want to have what Kirk has. I want to find a cause worthy of dedicating my life to, and I see coding as a vehicle to get there.
</p>

<P>What I think would make me a good fit for Launch Academy is that I have always thrived in team environments. Whether it was on the engineering team at Sylvania, my college capstone engineering team, or sports teams in high school I've always been more motivated to perform when other people are counting on me. There has also been many times when I've been dealt a tough role within a team where I've had to sacrifice some of my own individuality for a more fulfilling final product.
